# Virtual Police Station(VPS)
## Purpose
VPS provides an online platform to lodge a complaint against the injustice they are suffering from. So
Virtual Police Station (VPS) is a training tool to acquaint the public with the functioning of a police station
through the click of a mouse. The main objective of this innovative project is to demonstrate the police
station and acquaint the public with the functioning of a police station without actually going there in
person. It allows the police officials and public to enter every room of a computerized police station to
explore and learn the key procedures such as arrest, registration of complaints of sexual assault, dodge
threats and public get a feature of filing a complaint from the safety of their home.
## Intended Audience
VPS is a step towards the safety of the citizens firstly, so that they will be safe while filing a complaint and
secondly, it will create an awareness among the public or to be precise, the complainant that what is
happening with the case that they have filed and what is the update and it will also help them to give the
feedback by which they can even complaint against the department if their case is not handled properly.
It will also help in reducing the corruption by police officials and also provides a bridge between the police
officials and the monitoring department, which can keep and eye on every activity done by the police
officials and can prepare the progress report on the basis of what has been done for the case and can
analyze the crime rate accordingly. In short, VPS will help in humanizing the functioning of the police as
it is important to demonstrate the police station by exposing citizens to the layers of work - management,
administration, investigation. So that the public don't feel left out and keep an eye on every activity and
see whether their lodged complaint is taken care of or not i.e. see whether their case is being proceeded
or no action has been taken against filed complaint.
